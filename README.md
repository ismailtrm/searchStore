## Current Limitations
I am currently using a temporary server through [CORS Anywhere](https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo) to handle CORS issues. This is a temporary solution as I work on resolving CORS errors.

## Project Purpose
The goal of this project is to scrape data from various websites using vanilla JavaScript and display the information in a user-friendly manner.

The frontend is still a work in progress, and I am actively looking for contributors to help improve it. If you are interested in contributing, please reach out.
