# searchStore

A web application designed to scrape and display store data from various sites using vanilla JavaScript.

## Demo
You can view a live demo of the application [here](https://search-store.vercel.app).

## Features
- Search for stores
- Display store information
- Scrape data from multiple websites without any client app or browser bot

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

## Current Limitations
I am currently using a temporary server through [CORS Anywhere](https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo) to handle CORS issues. This is a temporary solution as I work on resolving CORS errors.

## Project Purpose
The goal of this project is to scrape data from various websites using vanilla JavaScript and display the information in a user-friendly manner.

## Scraping Method
Unlike traditional scraping libraries that create a bot or client, this application performs scraping directly through `fetch` requests. This allows for dynamic interaction with source websites without the need for additional scraping tools.

## Development Status
The frontend is still a work in progress, and I am actively looking for contributors to help improve it. If you are interested in contributing, please [reach out](ismailtarim7@gmail.com).
